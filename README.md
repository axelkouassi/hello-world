# hello-world
My first repository

My name is Axel Kouassi, I'm an aspiring Developer. I want to learn Front-End, Back-End, Android, ios.. pretty much everything there is to learn.
I was lucky to have gotten a three months scholarship in January from Google throigh Udacity to start my journey as a Front-End Development.
So I'm starting with Front-End Development.
